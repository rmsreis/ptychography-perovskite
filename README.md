A key to the unique combination of electronic and optical properties in halide perovskite materials lies in their rich structural complexity. However, their radiation sensitive nature limits nanoscale structural characterization requiring dose efficient microscopic techniques in order to determine their structures precisely. 

In this work, we determine the space-group and directly image the Br halide sites of CsPbBr3, a promising material for optoelectronic applications

This is repository containing the analysis of ptychographic datasets used to directly image a beam sensitive material (CsPbBr3)

### Background:
-----------------

Recently, halide-based perovskites have drawn substantial interest as promising materials for high-efficiency solar energy harvesting due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, low-cost, and material accessibility.

Most of the structural characterization studies in halide perovskites have been performed using X-ray or neutron diffraction.8–12,16,17 Unfortunately, these techniques offer a limited spatial resolution and low sensitivity to small symmetry deviations, such as the absence of center of symmetry and effects due to small atomic shifts.

For atomic resolution low dose imaging, we use electron ptychography, which is known for providing a quantitative measure of the phase changes of the incident coherent electron wave as it propagates through an electron transparent specimen.34 This technique offers a highly efficient phase contrast transfer function and excellent image contrast of light elements under low dose imaging conditions.
